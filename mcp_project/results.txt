### Findings on Multi-Agent Systems

#### Paper 1: From Single Agent to Multi-Agent: Improving Traffic Signal Control
- **Authors**: Maksim Tislenko, Dmitrii Kisilev
- **Published**: 2024-06-19
- **Summary**: The paper addresses the increasing importance of traffic signal control due to urbanization. It evaluates various existing methods and proposes increasing the number of agents to reduce average travel times. Experiments conducted on two datasets indicate that multiple agents can enhance existing methods, although the improvement from a fine-tuned large language model approach is minimal.
