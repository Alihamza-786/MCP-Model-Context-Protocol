    "summary": "Due to accelerating urbanization, the importance of solving the signal\ncontrol problem increases. This paper analyzes various existing methods and\nsuggests options for increasing the number of agents to reduce the average\ntravel time. Experiments were carried out with 2 datasets. The results show\nthat in some cases, the implementation of multiple agents can improve existing\nmethods. For a fine-tuned large language model approach there is small\nenhancement on all metrics.",
